## Team Preferences

#### Communication
In order to establish consistent and effective communication, our team will use Slack as a primary messaging system.
We should all try to be available between the hours of 9am and 5pm for Slack messaging. For higher level communication, 
we will use Microsoft Teams video calls. These should take place on most lecture days immediately after class ends. 
As a team, our goal for this semester is to learn how to communicate effectively and work well together. We may have
conflicts in approach, communication, and the lack of in person contact, but we will try to overcome those challenges.

#### Teamwork
In the interest of creating an inviting and collaborative work environment, our team members will offer help to one another
when someone needs it. Rather than a member being too afraid to ask for help and sit on the task until the last moment.
We agreed on using slack to send over snippets of code for review and or help. We also decided if we don't agree on
a design choice/code we will talk through it and get to a resolution we can agree on.

#### Grades / Responsibility
Our team discussed that while letter grades are important, all we should require of each other is that we try our best. 
The main goal we have is to learn new skills / technologies in this class.  If code is submitted that is of questionable quality,
we should discuss it in the standup.  We've decided that for the sake of future development, team members can be asked to go revise
code and improve the quality.  If team members feel that somebody isn't pulling their weight, our plan is to first discuss it openly
with each other, then approach TA's, then Professor Matthews upon each offence.  Differing opinions will be decided by a vote, but
if somebody has a different opinion, maybe it's worth consulting with other teams or staff.
