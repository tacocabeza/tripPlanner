## Team Preferences

#### Communication
In order to establish consistent and effective communication, our team will use Slack as a primary messaging system.
We should all try to be available between the hours of 9am and 5pm for Slack messaging. For higher level communication, 
we will use Microsoft Teams video calls. These should take place on most lecture days immediately after class ends. 
As a team, our goal for this semester is to learn how to communicate effectively and work well together. We may have
conflicts in approach, communication, and the lack of in person contact, but we will try to overcome those challenges.
