* Team Identification
	Displays our team name on both the client and the server so it appears in the header, footer, and browser tab.
* About

#### What went well
	
	The team was able to succesfully schedule a regular meeting time and determine best practices for the sprint. Task were assigned and completed on schedule by all team members. New tasks were created as needed and organized on ZenHub. 3 of the Epics were completed, while the remaining 2 were placed in the Icebox for next sprint.


#### Problems encountered and resolutions


## Retrospective

#### What went well
Our team did very well in maintaining lines of communication between each other.
All team members did their best to be active on the slack channel. Additionally, 
we were very quick to merge pull requests and so we had no merge conflicts. Also, all 
team members were able to make it to scrum meetings. The work was divided up between all of us rather evenly. Also, 
our team was their to answer/help on technical problems through the slack channel. Overall, things went rather smoothly.

#### Potential improvements
As noted above we did not have any merge conflicts but, we should really be examining
the code changed in pull requests. For example, not including a file when it is clearly referenced 
in the code in turn causing compilation issues in master. We should be looking for these kinds of bugs
when reviewing pull requests.

#### What we will change next time
Perhaps, we will do a better job of linking new issues to labels and epics on Zenhub.
Our time also discussed breaking down tasks further and providing better documentation in
our Github commits and pull requests.
