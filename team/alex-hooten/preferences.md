1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Slack, text, and email are the easiest ways to reach me. I should be available most days from 8am-10pm.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that our team will learn how to effectively work together to produce a quality product.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I plan to communicate more with my peers, ask my teammates how they are doing, and overall keep on top of the project.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * We may encounter merge conflicts, conflicts in the approach we want to take, and communication issues.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * The team members who want to get an A will need to discuss this with the team members who want to get a B. The team members who want to get an A can also reach out to Professor Matthews to discuss this problem.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I believe we should all hold each other accountable for doing the work. Nobody should have to pick up the slack of others.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I anticipate that this may take up to 8 hours of out of class time per week to be successful.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We will talk about our skillsets and see who is best suited for each role.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We will discuss with both them and Professor Matthews to ensure that it has a limited effect on the rest of the team.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Majority will hold sway in this instance. Individual team members may contact Professor Matthews if they think the quality will affect their grade.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We will discuss work habits to determine how best to collaborate.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least once, but likely twice per week.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * For smaller decisions, this is inefficient. For larger decisions, yes.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We should go with the majority, but make every effort to understand and compromise with the other team member.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Discuss with the team and make sure I and other team members speak up more in order to be heard.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Discuss with the team how they feel about this. Potentially try to delegate some of the facilitation responsibilities to other team members.
