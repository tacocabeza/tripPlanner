# Preferences for _Nick Davidson_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text \ Slack between 10am and 5pm email for the rest of the day.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * Try your best and get as much as we can get done. I would like that people stay on the task and get things done on time.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * To work on being more forward when it comes to getting work done.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Timing and time requirements, meaning we won't be able to work and meet together as much as I think would be good.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * There should be communications on what a good product would be without worrying about a grade only what we produce.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Everyone should do the work that they need to do to the best of their ability and if they feel someone isn't doing the work they should talk through a solution.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * This depends on the project, but I would say on average 3-4 hours of work.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think it would be best to discuss strengths and weaknesses to figure out who would fit best and who wants to do different aspects.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Then our team would be penalized. If you know you are falling behind it would be in the best interest of the team to communicate, so we can all succeed.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Then we can all get together as a team and talk about what we think is needed for our success.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * As long as the work gets done I don't really care the different habits of team members.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think it could be helpful to meet once a week or just send a message once a week of what you're doing and what you have done.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think before work gets started on a sprint and towards the end of the sprint and some meetings in the middle to keep on track, but that all depends on the project were working on.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * This depends on the decision, such as a small line of code no, however something that affects others yes.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * If there is a reasonable explanation why the teammate doesn't agree then we should hear them out, however for the most case go with the majority.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Talk to them and see if there is a way to get back on track for all team members.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will reach out to the team and voice my thoughts, so we can try to resolve the issues.
