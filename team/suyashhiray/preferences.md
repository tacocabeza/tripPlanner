1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text, slack, and email all work, anytime from 9am until around midnight.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I hope we can successfully work together to create a working project and communicate as a team.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to be able to better communicate in a timely manner and be available for my teammates whenever they need me.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Being remote, it can be harder to all be on the same page at times. I hope we can communicate and stay in touch regularly to avoid any miscommunication.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * We should stop and have a conversation as a team and come to a solution that works best for all of us.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I think that we should strive to all contribute the same amount of work to the assignments. If someone chooses to go above and beyond I think they should be recognized for it by getting an A.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I'm assuming around 6-7 hours a week, although at this point I have no idea what the project actually entails.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We should talk about our different skills or backgrounds and decide on splitting up the work that way.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I believe that the first step is to just talk to the person and figure out what happened, I'm sure in most cases the reason for missing a commitment can be worked out amongst team members. From there we can set forth a plan to better reach our individual goals for the next deadline. If theres any contention we can talk to the TAs or Professor.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Look at the work as a whole team and get everyone's opinion, put it to a vote.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I'm of the opinion work as you want, as long as you're meeting our deadlines or standards.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Twice a week would be ideal, I don't want any of us to get stuck or do a large chunk of work that is then scrapped.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Only on bigger design decisions, the small stuff can be managed by each person.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We would have to have that person plead their case, and just go with the majority vote.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I would have to talk to them and explain that this is an opportunity for all of us to voice our opinions and learn.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I would have to talk to my teammates and ask them to help or how they would want to split up responsibilites.
