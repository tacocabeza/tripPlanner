# Preferences for Preston Dunton

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   Text is best.  I can be reached most anytime, though I try to sleep 12-8:30, and I have marching band from 3-6:30.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   As long as you're trying your best to learn, and you're doing your fair share, I think we'll be ok.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   I've had some leadership experience before, so I'm hoping this time I can be more of an enabler to help others learn leadership skills.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   I expect most people are going to want to work on the same thing.  Let's assign things randomly sometimes so we can get some breadth in our skills?
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   We should define settle/expected/reach grades so that we can have a spetrum to work with and talk about.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   Yes, but only if everybody has contributed enough to reach a B, or otherwise acceptable lower grade.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   I have no idea how my semester is going to play out, but let's start by saying 6 hours? Idk.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   We need to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses.  I want my team to explore out of their comfort zone, while being effective inside of their zone when needed.  Let's share skills!
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   Communicate directly and address issue as a team.  Go ask TA's and Dave as needed beyond that.  Mistakes happen, but we need to communicate well.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   Ask for a third opinion inside the team to break a tie.  Authors have a responsibility to write **good** code and go back to fix bad code.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   I respect people who don't work like I do.  If they like to work in the middle of the night, that's cool.  Just needs to be acceptable by Dave's standards and not inhibiting the team's work.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   Not necessary, but I would like to establish times where we can expect everybody to be online/working to answer a question or to chat.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   If we are efficient, I don't think we have to.  I would ask 1 to 2 hours tops if we need it.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   For larger UI and architecture decisions, yes.  For other things, I would like to work on trusting team members more.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   I might go ahead with the majority on this one, but maybe reaching out to a TA or to another team might be a good checkpoint for us.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   Ask them to let the others have some room to grow.  Team success is personal success.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   Ask for help from team first, then TA's / Dave if there's a problem.  I like to be helpful, but I know that I have a limit.
